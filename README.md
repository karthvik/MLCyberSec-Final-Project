# Anomaly Detection for Credit Card Fraud: A Deep Learning Approach

## Project Summary
This repository showcases the project for the EL-GY-9163 Machine Learning for Cyber-security course at New York University. The focus is on replicating and improving a deep learning model for detecting fraud in credit card transactions, inspired by the research of Tung-Yu Wu and You-Ting Wang.

## Execution Instructions
- *Dataset Acquisition*: 
  - Download the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).
  - Save the dataset in a directory within the project folder.

- *Notebook Configuration*: 
  - Update the dataset path in Project_Main.ipynb to reflect the location of your downloaded dataset.

- *Notebook Execution*: 
  - Run Project_Main.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook to review the project's implementation and results.
